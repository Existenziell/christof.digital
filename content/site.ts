    text: "I know Chris since many year. He has always been very athletic and drawn to natural movement patterns. His Yoga classes reflect this elemental passion for the body. He has a great knowledge about how to move in asana, how to align in the best way and what each asana is suitable and beneficial for. I love his positive vibe and the relaxed, calm teaching style, as it allows me to completely surrender into the single position or flow. After each class I feel centered, balanced and whole - and you can't ask for more in a good Yoga class. Thank you 💛",

    text: "I came across Chris in Nepal . I went to learn from him for more than 2 wks daily, one of my highlight in Pokhara! Christof taught from his heart and made each session super fun. He knows what he is doing & made our sessions light but still challenging. I felt good after practise with him as it helped me to raise my energy up. When I wanted to learn sth , I needed to know how and why we re doing it.  If I don't get it , its hard for me to carry on / do it . Chris did all he cld to make it fun , understandable for me & patiently explain poses in a way that raises my interest towards ashtanga yoga. I'm truly grateful for the time , energy he spent on me . Thank you teacher. U taught me to trust myself more, to breathe slowly in life & if we look things in another angle, everything shifts , what seems scary ll shift to sth beautiful. Just like Sirsasana! 🙂",
