## About

I have worked with JavaScript for over 20 years and always loved web development and the rapid pace of innovation. Seeing JavaScript becoming so ubiquitous over the last years is amazing and I really enjoy the current ecosystem. I am always on the search for interesting projects and am passionate about using my craft to make the world a better place. Other areas of interest include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain and Low Level Programming with Arduino/RaspberryPie.
